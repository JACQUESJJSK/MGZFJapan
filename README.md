This markdown script presents the core of the methodological framework for my study of Chinese historiography on the the Japan-educated students in the late imperial and republican period.
I developed this script as part of the paper titled "Japan-Educated Officials in China’s Wartime Central Administration (1944)". In this paper, I present a reviews of the literature on the Chinese students who went to Japan to study between 1896 and 1945. While the literature in English and Japanese is small and allwo for close reading, the literature in Chinese is massive. To explore this literature and identify research trends, I chose to apply topic modeling to the dataet of references extracted from CNKI (知網). The documentary basis consists in the abstracts of the academic outputs, including journal article,s M.A. thesis, and doctoral dissertations.
